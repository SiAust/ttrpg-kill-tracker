What does it mean when I keep reading words wrong?

I get this from time to time but it seems to correlate with periods when I'm stressed or depressed. What seems to happen is I read a sentence and the first time a word, typically the first word of the sentence, will be something different but it will be a word starting with the same letter. For example, I may read the sentence "Build a house" as "Brush a house", as a moment my mind seems to correct itself. Is this a type of dyslexia? Related to visionary issues I keep seeing what you might describe as something out the corner of my eye, then glance at it, and it's just a normal object, where and how it should be. For a moment though, it feels like it's something else, like a person, a cat, a object that I need to pay attention to.

Sounds like I'm completely losing my mind! It's not frequent but happens at least a couple of times daily, at worst.
